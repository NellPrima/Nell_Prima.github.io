            Pegasus is a prominent constellation in the northern sky, named 
            after a winged horse in Greek mythology. The constellation is one 
            of the older ones known in the night sky: It is one of the 48 
            constellations listed by the second-century astronomer Ptolemy. 
            Today, Pegasus is one of the 88 constellations officially recognized 
            by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).<br>In the Northern 
            Hemisphere, the constellation is high in the sky starting near the 
            end of summer and continuing through autumn. If you are below the 
            equator, look for Pegasus in late winter and through spring.<br>The 
            constellation is famous for hosting the first exoplanet ever found 
            around a normal star, as well as a galaxy known as M15.
