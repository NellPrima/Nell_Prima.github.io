                    The significant link to the right brain is pretty clear. 
                    The specialized characteristics of the right hemisphere 
                    make it the seat of curiosity, synergy, experimentation, 
                    metaphoric thinking, playfulness, solution-finding, 
                    artistry, flexibility, synthesizing, and in general, 
                    risk-taking. Such as the left brain is more of a computer. 
                    Right brain focus on the colorful said if I must say. It 
                    shows you the creative side of the world. The different 
                    color or different ideas that brings joy to you. Even will 
                    show you ideas to bring out your creative side. The right 
                    brain shows your emotions and how to understand them. 
                    Like if you’re friend is sad. Your right brain will help 
                    you get ideas on how to comfort them.

                    What’s The Point of Left Brain?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    the left brain is generally responsible for logic and 
                    language, while the right is responsible for creativity 
                    and intuition. In reality, both sides work together, and 
                    stronger skills result from the two hemispheres working 
                    well together. The left is important because it makes sure 
                    to stop you from doing stupid stuff (for most people). 
                    People who are especially skilled in one area or a certain t
                    ype of activity are often considered left or right-brained.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The thought behind this is that one side is stronger than 
                    the other, but that’s not the case. Instead, each side is 
                    more or less responsible for certain roles or areas of f
                    ocus. For example, if there is an art project your right 
                    brain takes control and gives you all the colorful ideas. 
                    The right brain is responsible for creativity. Now if there
                    was a serious problem like surgery, final exams, bills, 
                    and business. Left Brain takes control and gives you the 
                    local and smart why how to handle them. Giving you more 
                    ways to think and analyze the situation. The left brain is 
                    responsible for local and responsible thinking.

                    How do the Right Brain and Left Brain Benefit each other?

                </div>
                <p>
                    The left brain is associated with logic, analytical 
                    thinking, and language processing, while the right brain 
                    is linked with creativity, intuition, and holistic 
                    thinking. However, this is an oversimplification, as both 
                    hemispheres cooperate in most activities. The left brain 
                    may think locally but sometimes it will need the right 
                    brain to think outside of the box. Like a science project! 
                    Left Brain will think of the ways a volcano sculpture will 
                    go off and the timing of everything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the right brain will focus on building the sculpture. 
                    The colors, the clay it’ll use, and how it’ll look. The 
                    right brain will bring in the creativity while the left 
                    brain will bring in the smarts. In the end, they make 
                    perfect business partners.

                    Will One of the Side or Shine the other?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    That is a funny topic. At some point in time right brain 
                    will out shine left brain and, the left brain will outshine 
                    the right brain. It depends on the activity you are 
                    working on. For example, if you are in a text or working 
                    on math left brain will be the best side to use because of 
                    its smart thinking and its way of analyzing a problem. 
                    Left Brain will look at the problem and pull it apart just 
                    to give you the right answer. Left Brain will break it 
                    down step by step to help you understand the problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for the right brain, if you use it for tests and math. 
                    it won’t give you the same answer because that’s not its 
                    job too. The right brain is for art projects, adventuring, 
                    opening up to new things, and just having fun. It’s the 
                    “not so boring” side of you. The right brain gives you the 
                    colorful side of things. Not like the left brain at all! 
                    The right Brain will let you feel things that the left 
                    brain couldn’t, Emotions like no other. It shines the left 
                    brain in feeling, art, enjoyment, and passion. They both 
                    outshine each other in different things. But also work 
                    together as one.
