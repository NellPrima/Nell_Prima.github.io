                <h1>The Bogeyman</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    The bogeyman (/ˈboʊɡimæn/; also spelled or known as bogyman,
                    [1] bogy,[1] bogey,[1] and, in North American English, also 
                    boogeyman)[1] is a mythical creature used by adults to frigh 
                    children into good behaviour. Bogeymen have no specific 
                    appearance and conceptions vary drastically by household and 
                    culture, but they are most commonly depicted as masculine or 
                    androgynous monsters that punish children for misbehaviour.
                    [2] The bogeyman and conceptually similar monsters can be 
                    found many cultures around the world. Bogeymen may target a 
                    specif act or general misbehaviour, depending on the purpose 
                    of invoking the figure, often on the basis of a warning from 
                    an authority figure to a child. The term is sometimes used
                    as a non-specific personification of, or metonym for, terror
                    , and sometimes the Devil.[3]

                <p>
                    The word bogeyman, used to describe an angel in English, 
                    comes from Middle English bugge or bogge, which means 
                    'frightening spectre'. Bogeyman itself is known from the 
                    15th century, though bogeyman stories are almost certainly 
                    much older.[4] It may derive from Middle English bogge or 
                    bugge, meaning a 'terror' or'scarecrow'. It relates to 
                    boggart, bugbear (from bug, meaning 'goblin' or 'scarecrow')
                    and bear (an imaginary demon in the form of a bear that ate 
                    small children.) It was also used to  mean a general object 
                    of dread. The word bugaboo, with a similar pair of meanings,
                    may have arisen as an alteration of bugbear. [5]

                    Descriptions of the bogeyman vary across cultures, yet there 
                    are often commonalities between them. These may include 
                    having claws/talons, or sharp teeth. The nature of the 
                    creature also varies from culture to culture, although most 
                    examples are said to be a kind of spirit, with demons, 
                    witches, and other legendary creatures being less common 
                    variants. Some are described as having certain animal 
                    features such as horns, hooves, and bugl ike appearances.

                    Because of the myth’s worldwide prevalence, it is difficult 
                    to find the original source of the legends. The Bogeyman was 
                    first referenced for the hobgoblins described in the 16th 
                    century England. Many believed that they were made to 
                    torment humans, and while some only played simple pranks, 
                    others were more foul in nature.[7][unreliable source?]

                   Bogeymen, or bogeyman-like beings, are common to the folklore 
                    of many cultures, with numerous variations and equivalents.

                A variant called the Sack Man exists in many Latin American 
                cultures, such as those of Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay, 
                Brazil, as well as in both Portugal and Spain. He is variously 
                referred to as el Hombre del costal, el hombre de la bolsa, el 
                hombre del saco, or in Portuguese, o homem do saco, all of these
                names meaning "the sack  man" or "the bag man". Another Spanish 
                language variation is el ro
                ba-chicos, meaning "child-stealer". Similar legends are present
                in Eastern Europe (e.g. Bulgarian Torbalan, "sack man"), as 
                well as in Haiti and some countries in Asia.[8][failed

                El Coco (also El Cuco and Cucuy, sometimes called El Bolo) is a 
                monster common to many Spanish-speaking countries. The Cuca Fera 
                [ca] (or Cucafera) monster is the equivalent in certain parts of 
                Catalonia.
