            The Andromeda constellation consists of 16 stars visible in 
            the northern sky. Named by ancient Greeks after the mythological 
            Andromeda princess, the constellation contains the Andromeda 
            Galaxy, the nearest full-fledged galaxy to our own Milky Way.

            In ancient Greek mythology, Andromeda was a beautiful daughter of 
            the king Cepheus and queen Cassiopeia. When her mother bragged that 
            Andromeda was better-looking than the famously beautiful Nereid sea 
            nymphs, the sea god Poseidon sent his pet sea monster Cetus to 
            destroy Cepheus' kingdom.<br>It was said, however, that sacrificing 
            Andromeda could save the country and its people. So, the loving 
            parents had their daughter chained to a rock by the sea, so that 
            the sea monster could get her easily. Fortunately, the charming 
            prince Perseus flew past on his winged horse Pegasus and fell in 
            love with Andromeda's beauty. He killed Cetus and married Andromeda. 
            The two lived happily ever after.
