            Perseus is the 24th largest constellation in the night sky and is 
            visible across the Northern Hemisphere and parts of the Southern 
            Hemisphere.

            Perseus is best known as the radiant of August's Perseid meteor 
            shower, one of the most prolific meteor showers of the year, as 
            well as the variable star Algol, also known as the Demon Star. 
            Algol fluctuates in brightness, appearing to "wink" in the night 
            sky — this occurs when its two binary components eclipse 
            one another.

            Perseus was a Greek hero, a demigod born of Zeus and Danae. 
            According to GreekMythology.com, Perseus was tasked by the Greek 
            king Polydectes to fetch the head of Medusa, the only mortal Gorgon. 
            The gorgons were a trio of sisters with snakes for hair, whose gaze 
            turned men to stone. Polydectes gave Perseus this task with the hope 
            it would kill him, allowing Polydectes to forcibly marry Danae, 
            who had rejected his advances.
            <br>The legend has many tie-ins to Perseus' neighboring 
            constellations Andromeda, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, Cetus and Pegasus. 
            On his journey home after slaying Medusa, Perseus saved Andromeda, 
            the daughter of Cassiopeia and Cephus, from being sacrificed to the 
            sea monster Cetus. He later married Andromeda, and the two 
            constellations named for the pair are next to each other in the 
            sky. Perseus is also involved with the origin story of Pegasus, 
            the winged horse — Pegasus emerged from Medusa's body after Perseus 
            beheaded her.
